        <p>We are surrounded by many different businesses. Some are large companies with
            household names, such as Heinz or Apple. Others are much smaller, such as local
            shops and taxi firms. Some produce goods, such as fruit growers and water companies.
            Others make or sell them, from ice creams to furniture. Others provide a service, such
            as window cleaning and hairdressing. Some operate only online, for example Amazon.

        <p>All these businesses originated when someone came up with a good idea which they
            turned into a reality. Understanding what makes enterprises successful is important for
            anyone who wants to work in business or start up their own. In this unit you will explore
            different types of businesses and create a model for a business start-up in your local
            area. Identifying realistic opportunities and researching your own ideas will help you to
            discover more about businesses in your own area and the factors that affect them.</p>
