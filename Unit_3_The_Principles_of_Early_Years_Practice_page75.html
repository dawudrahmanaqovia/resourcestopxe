            Children who are in inclusive settings are likely to make good progress. This is because
            a wide range of play opportunities, equipment and activities will be available. It is also
            because adults are thinking about their needs and interests. Adults will try to work
            out what play, equipment or materials the child needs. By thinking about a child’s
            individual needs, adults may also be in a better position to realise when additional
            help is required.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
            An inclusive setting will work with other professionals, such as speech and language
            therapists, to make sure that a child is helped. Inclusive settings may also adapt what
            they do to meet children’s needs. They may paint a table white so that a child with
            sight problems can see jigsaw puzzles or plates more easily. For a child who needs a
            frame to walk with, they may change the layout so that the child can get inside the role
            play area.

            Play is important for children’s overall development. It is also enjoyable and enables
            children to practise social skills. Inclusive settings help children to play and be with
            others. Adults in inclusive settings think about what help children need so that they
            can play. An example of this is when an adult helps a child to play with others or adapts
            games so that a child can join in. Where settings show this type of inclusive practice,
            children will not only gain social skills through play, but will also learn to express
            feelings and emotions.
