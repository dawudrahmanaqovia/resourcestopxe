            If children’s needs are not identifi ed quickly, this can affect their learning and
            development. An example of this is hearing. If a child is not fully hearing, they will fi nd
            it harder to make progress with their speech and language.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
            As well as recognising the individual needs of children, it is important that adults meet
            these needs. A child who is just learning to talk needs adults to take time to listen
            carefully to them. If adults do not take the time to listen, the child will stop trying to
            communicate.

            Children become poorly if their health needs are not met. These include skin care, a
            balanced diet, enough to drink and also appropriate clothing. Where settings do not
            meet these needs, children are more likely to have health problems.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
            For those children with existing health needs, these can become worse. A baby who
            has <span class="keyword">eczema</span>, but whose nappy is not changed quickly, is likely to develop nappy rash.
            This might become infected. A child who is allergic to dairy products might become
            seriously ill if they are given ordinary milk.

            level has to be monitored
            and he needs regular injections. He also cannot go for long periods without
            food. Without insulin and food being given at the right time, Jayden can become
            dangerously ill. His parents are keen for him to go to nursery so that he can play
            with other children and benefi t from activities. They have told the nursery about
            his medical condition and his needs. They have also decided that if there are any
            problems, they will keep Jayden at home so that they can be sure he is safe.
