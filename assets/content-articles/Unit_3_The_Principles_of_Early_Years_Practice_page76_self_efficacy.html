        <p class="normal-text">
            <span class="keyword">Self-efficacy</span> is linked to self-image. It is about the way you think about your potential
            and can also be called a ‘can do’ attitude. Children who are developing a strong sense
            of self-effi cacy are more likely to have a go at new skills and experiences. They have
            learned that with time and practice they are likely to master them.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
            Children without a strong sense of self-efficacy are likely to give up easily or not try out
            things, believing that they will not be able to do them. Inclusive settings make children
            feel that they are capable and help them develop this sense of ‘can do’.
