            practice is that every child is important and should be helped and welcomed.

    <p class="normal-text">
        It should not matter what a child’s race, background or lifestyle is. Nor should it
        matter how old the child is or whether they have a disability. Inclusive practice means
        that every child and their family should be able to benefi t from the services and
        opportunities that early year settings offer. In this section we look at the positive ways
        in which inclusive practice can help children.

            There are many reasons why early years settings provide inclusive practice.

        <h1 class="c-head">Self-image</h1>
        <p class="normal-text">
            During the fi rst years of life children are learning about themselves. Their self-image is
            developing. What they learn depends on the experiences they have. It also depends
            on how they are treated. Children who feel that they are liked by adults in early years
            settings are more likely to develop a positive self-image. Children who feel that adults
            believe in them are also likely to try out new things and be motivated. Being liked and
            cared for helps children to be positive about others.
