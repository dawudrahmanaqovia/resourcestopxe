            Inclusive settings think hard about children’s needs. They also try to make sure that
            children try out new experiences and activities that will help them learn. Where there
            is non-inclusive practice, children may not be given the support and time they need
            to do as well as other children. For example, a child who needs more time to respond
            than the other children will lose out if additional time is not provided. Over time,
            this may result in the child not having the same opportunities to learn. It may lead to
            children not doing as well in school.

            You have been asked to write an article about inclusive practice in early years
            settings. You can use examples from the case studies of Hazir and Aidan – see
            pages 77 and 78.<br/>
            Your article should cover:

                <li><span class="assessment-activity-text-tip">When giving examples of the impact on children of inclusive and non-inclusive practice, you need to explain in
                detail the consequences of inclusive and non-inclusive practice and give reasons for your statements. Make sure
                that you explain the similarities and differences of each type of practice and refer to both case studies.
