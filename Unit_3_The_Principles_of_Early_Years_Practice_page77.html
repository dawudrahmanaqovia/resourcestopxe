            The way that you are treated infl uences the way that you are likely to treat others.
            Inclusive practice helps children to be warm and caring because they have this
            experience themselves. An inclusive setting also helps children to value others
            regardless of age, disability, race, background, gender or lifestyle. Children learn this
            from seeing adults value everyone. Inclusive practice also helps children to explore
            their surroundings in a positive way and learn about the differences between people.

        <p class="case-text lc_case-text">Hazir is 3 years old. His mother would like him to go to the local playgroup. She
            is worried that, because she is new to the country and that Hazir does not speak
            English, they will not be accepted. Hazir and his mother live in a cramped bedsit.
            Hazir has severe <span class="keyword"><b>asthma</b></span>, which needs careful management. There are few toys
            and he is often bored.
        </p>

        <p class="case-text lc_case-text">When Hazir’s mother decides to visit the playgroup, staff are friendly and
            welcoming. A short while afterwards, Hazir is attending three sessions a week. He
            is very happy. There are plenty of play opportunities and new experiences for him.
            His key person helps him join in with the other children and he is quickly learning
            to talk in English. He is making good progress in other areas of development
            too, especially social skills and physical development. The setting understands
            his health needs and keeps an eye on his breathing, especially during physical
            activities.
