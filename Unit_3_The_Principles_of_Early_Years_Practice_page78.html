        <p class="intro-text lc_intro-text">By law, early years settings have to show that they are meeting children’s needs and are
            showing inclusive practice. In this section we look at why inclusive practice is so important
            and why non-inclusive practice can be damaging to children.

        <p class="normal-text">
            There are a number of different ways in which children might be affected by being in a
            setting that does not demonstrate inclusive practice.
        </p>

        <h1 class="c-head">Poor self-image</h1>
        <p class="normal-text">
            We have seen that children’s self-image is developing from an early age. It is important
            for children to learn that they are liked and also that they can do things for themselves.
            Children can develop poor-self image if they are always reliant on adults to help them
            or if they see that other children are liked more. Poor self-image means that children
            start to think they are not as good as other children. Over time this leads to a lack of
            confi dence.
        </p>

        <h1 class="c-head">Low self-efficacy</h1>
        <p class="normal-text">
            As well as developing a positive self-image, children need to think that they have the
            potential to be competent. If the environment or layout of a setting is not suitable
            for a child, they may often have to wait for help and may need to rely on others to
            do things for them. This means that children learn to be helpless and passive. This is
            called ‘learned helplessness’. Over time, this means that children may give up quickly
            or believe that there is no point in trying to help themselves.

        <p class="case-text lc_case-text">Aidan is 4 years old. He has signifi cant mobility and physical needs as a result of
            a birthing injury. He was in a setting where there were no ramps or adaptations.
            He had to be lifted in and out of his wheelchair. He could not move around easily
            because the layout had not been changed. He often spent time sitting, waiting for
            adults to move him from one activity to another. Adults in the setting would dress
            him because it was quicker for them, even though he could manage tops, shirts
            and jumpers unaided. His parents were worried that he was ‘giving up’. He is now
            in an inclusive setting where he can, with some effort, move himself around. Staff
            also give him time and encouragement to do as much as he can alone.
