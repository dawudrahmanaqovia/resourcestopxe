            <p>We are surrounded by many different businesses. Some are large companies with<br/>
                household names, such as Heinz or Apple. Others are much smaller, such as local<br/>
                shops and taxi firms. Some produce goods, such as fruit growers and water companies.<br/>
                Others make or sell them, from ice creams to furniture. Others provide a service, such<br/>
                as window cleaning and hairdressing. Some operate only online, for example Amazon.</p>

            <p>All these businesses originated when someone came up with a good idea which they<br/>
                turned into a reality. Understanding what makes enterprises successful is important for<br/>
                anyone who wants to work in business or start up their own. In this unit you will explore<br/>
                different types of businesses and create a model for a business start-up in your local<br/>
                area. Identifying realistic opportunities and researching your own ideas will help you to<br/>
                discover more about businesses in your own area and the factors that affect them.</p>

                I enjoy watching programmes like <i>Young<br/>
                Apprentice and Dragons’ Den</i> and would like<br/>
                to have my own business one day. My brother<br/>
                started a ‘man with a van’ business last year.<br/>
                He got the idea when my parents couldn’t get<br/>
                a sofa delivered cheaply. I now want to think<br/>
                of a start-up idea for myself.

<section class="How you will be assessed">
    <h1>How you will be assessed</h1>
    <p>The unit will be assessed by a series of internally assessed tasks. You will research your own ideas <br/>
        for a start-up business and prepare an initial plan which shows that you have considered current <br/>
        trends and the needs of your local business environment. You will then plan your business model, <br/>
        deciding which would be the best format for your own business and giving reasons for your choice. <br/>
        You will need to prepare explanatory notes to support your model before you present it.</p>

    <p>Your evidence for this unit will be collected and prepared throughout your course and stored in a <br/>
        portfolio, together with any observation records or witness statements.</p>

    <p> Your assessment could be in the form of:
    <ul>
        <li>a business model with explanatory notes</li>
        <li>a presentation in which you put forward your ideas and/or business model and answer questions<br/>
            about it</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</section>

<section class="More about your portfolio">
    <h2>More about your portfolio</h2>
    <p>Your portfolio must contain the information you have researched, your notes and other evidence<br/>
        that led you to make certain decisions about your proposed business.</p>

    <p>This should be divided into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ideas for your start-up business</li>
        <li>Research for the start-up business</li>
        <li>Initial plan for a business idea</li>
        <li>Format of business start-up and reasons<br/>
            for choice</li>
        <li>Business model</li>
        <li>Presentation</li>
        <li>Observation records/witness statements. <br/>
            These may be from your teacher/tutor,<br/>
            other learners in your group or other<br/>
            contacts you have made as part of your<br/>
            investigations or research.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1> How you will be assessed</h1>

    <p>This unit will be assessed by a series of tasks set by your tutor. You will be expected to show an<br/>
        understanding of short-term responses and long-term adaptations of the body systems to exercise,<br/>
        and the different energy systems that are used during sports performance. The tasks will be based<br/>
        on scenarios involving work or activity in a sports setting. For example, you might be asked to<br/>
        imagine you are working in a leisure centre as an assistant fitness instructor and have been asked to<br/>
        produce posters to make customers more aware of the different bene ts of exercise.</p>

    <p> Your assessment could be in the form of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>informative materials such as posters or leaflets</li>
        <li>presentations</li>
        <li>practical investigations.</li>

<h1>The role of sales staff</h1>
<section class="Introduction to The role of sales staff">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sales staff work in a wide range of businesses. You often see sales staff at work in shops<br/>
        on the high street. You may have been stopped in the street by a salesperson, or been<br/>
        telephoned at home. Think of one good experience and one bad experience you have had<br/>
        with a salesperson. How have your impressions of sales staff affected your opinion of the<br/>
        product/service they were selling?</p>
</section>

<section class="The role of sales staff">
    <p>The principal job of all sales staff is to make a sale. To be successful, a salesperson has<br/>
        to be knowledgeable about the product they are selling and skilful in the way they<br/>
        make a sale.</p>

    <p>Sales staff are crucial to the success of many businesses. They are the public face of an<br/>
        organisation and are very influential in the customer’s decision as to whether or not to<br/>
        make a purchase. As well as making a sale, the sales person has a number of other roles.</p>
</section>

<section class="Selling">
    <h2>Selling</h2>
    <p>Selling is the most important part of the salesperson's job. Sales staff around the world sell
        millions of different things, but what they sell normally fits into the following categories:
    </p>

            company’s reputation, reliability.</td>

<section class="Discussion">
    <h5>Discussion</h5>
    <p>
        In a group, discuss your<br/>
        experiences of aggressive,<br/>
        high-pressure selling, known<br/>
        as hard selling. Do you think<br/>
        that it encourages people<br/>
        to buy? When can its use<br/>
        be criticised?</p>

</section>

<section class="Providing information">
    <h3>Providing information</h3>

    <p> Sales staff give information to the customer about the product. They must <br/>
        communicate in a way that the customer will understand. A person selling laptops <br/>
        needs to be able to simplify the features of a laptop so that a customer with little <br/>
        knowledge of IT can understand what they are buying. They should be able to adapt <br/>
        their approach and use more technical language for the more IT literate customer.</p>
</section>

<section class="Dealing with routine enquiries">
    <h3>Dealing with routine enquiries</h3>

    <p>Customers may have many questions including questions about the product itself,<br/>
        the range of products offered, the shop’s opening hours, the company’s policy on<br/>
        exchanging goods and whether the company sells online.</p>

    <p>Customers are not impressed if a salesperson is unable to answer their questions, as<br/>
        this gives a poor impression of the business.</p>
</section>


<section class="Representing the organisation">
    <h3>Representing the organisation</h3>

    <p>Sales staff represent the business and the product. They are often the first person<br/>
        the customer comes into contact with when they see the product, and many<br/>
        customers judge the product on their impression of the sales staff. It is essential<br/>
        that sales staff make a good impression by dressing and behaving appropriately<br/>
        and by being informative.</p>
</section>

<section class="Remember">
    <h4>Remember</h4>
    <p>It only takes a few seconds for<br/>
        somebody to judge you when<br/>
        they  rst come into contact<br/>
        with you. People use your<br/>
        appearance, body language<br/>
        and mannerisms to form an<br/>
        impression of you and this<br/>
        happens every time you meet<br/>
        somebody new. Sales staff<br/>
        should aim to make great first<br/>
        impressions and never forget<br/>
        that they are the public face of<br/>
        the business.</p>

    <h1>Knowledge and skills</h1>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p>Who do you think would be the most successful salesperson: someone who is shy but hard<br/>
        working, or someone who is outgoing but not particularly conscientious?</p>

    <p>The answer is probably neither of them. A shy person might struggle to deal with people, but<br/>
        the outgoing person who is not very hard working might not be motivated enough to learn<br/>
        the additional knowledge and practise the necessary skills to become effective in their job.</p>
</section>

<section class="What knowledge and skills do sales people need?">
    <h2>What knowledge and skills do sales people need? </h2>

    <h3>Product knowledge</h3>

    <p>Sales staff must know enough about a product and how it works to match the customer
        with the appropriate product. Sales staff should know the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Stock availability – what is normally available and when out-of-stock items will<br/>
            become available</li>
        <li>Price information – the prices of the products and how these compare with other<br/>
            available products</li>
        <li>Store information – location of products in the shop and the delivery/collection<br/>
            arrangements</li>
        <li>Product care – how to look after the product and what after-sales service is available<br/>
            such as warranties, servicing and repair</li>
        <li>Key information – how to demonstrate how the product works. The main features,<br/>
            uses and what variations in colour, size etc. are available.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="Activity">
    <h3>Activity</h3> <h4>Demonstrating Product Knowledge</h4>

    <p>You have received two emails from friends who have job interviews next week for<br/>
        part-time sales jobs. One friend has an interview at a pet shop and the other has<br/>
        an interview at a mobile phone shop. Both of them are very excited, but worried<br/>
        that they do not know enough about what the shop sells. Choose one friend to<br/>
        help and send them an email giving them advice on what you think they should<br/>
        know about the products sold in the shop. Also, advise them about where they<br/>
        can find the information they need.</p>
</section>

<section class="Key Terms">
    <h4>Key Terms</h4>

    <p><b>Cross-selling</b> – suggesting a<br/>
        related product to a customer<br/>
        to increase the overall sale,<br/>
        for example a hair spray to go<br/>
        with a haircut.</p>

    <p><b>Up-selling</b> – promoting a<br/>
        more profitable alternative to<br/>
        increase the value of the sale.</p>
</section>

<section class="Activity">
    <h3>Activity</h3>
    <h4>Role-playing Sales situations</h4>

    <p>In pairs, role-play a number of sales situations where a salesperson uses cross-selling<br/>
        to suggest a related item to the customer.</p>
</section>

<section class="Understanding potential customers">
    <h4>Understanding potential customers</h4>
    <p>Being able to identify potential customers<br/>
        and understand their requirements is<br/>
        vital to being able to recommend the<br/>
        right product to the customer. This also<br/>
        helps sales staff to communicate with<br/>
        customers’ appropriately.</p>

    <p>Some people are naturally more intuitive<br/>
        and have better interpersonal skills, but<br/>
        salespeople who carefully listen and ask<br/>
        the right questions can learn more about<br/>
        the potential customer.</p>
</section>

<section class="Introduction to Demonstrate personal selling skills">
    <h1>Demonstrate personal selling skills</h1>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p>Personal selling skills: Are you ready to make a sale? Is your appearance and attitude right?<br/>
        Do you know how to communicate with the customer? Can you close a sale?</p>

    <p>The selling process: Do you understand what you have to do to make a sale? Are you able to<br/>
        manage other sales-related tasks such as handling customer complaints?</p>

    <p>Sales staff continually learn and improve their skills throughout their careers, but if you<br/>
        want to get ahead, preparation and practice are the key to success.</p>
</section>

<section class="Did you know">
    <h4>Did you know? </h4>
    <p>Businesses attempt to increase<br/>
        their sales staff’s motivation<br/>
        by paying them a sum of<br/>
        money, known as commission,<br/>
        based on the value of what<br/>
        they sell. This means that top<br/>
        salespeople can earn a lot<br/>
        of money. However, some<br/>
        jobs are paid commission<br/>
        only, which means that the<br/>
        salesperson only earns money<br/>
        if they make a sale.</p>
</section>


<section class="Sales preparation skills">
    <h3>Sales preparation skills</h3>

    <p>The physical sales environment, that is the shop, the market stall, the car showroom<br/>
        or the exhibition hall, is very important in enticing customers to make purchases. The<br/>
        sales environment should be welcoming, clean and tidy and products should be clearly<br/>
        displayed and be accessible to everyone.</p>
    <p>The design of the sales environment should reflect the business’ image. Sales staff<br/>
        are often involved in the preparation of the sales environment, and depending on<br/>
        their position in the company and the size of the business, they may be involved in<br/>
        designing, setting up and maintaining displays and exhibition stands.</p>
    <p>Some interesting tactics used to increase sales:</p>
    <p>Fast music can be used to encourage customers to purchase more quickly. This is<br/>
        useful during busy periods in a fast food outlet. Slow music can be used to encourage<br/>
        customers to take their time when buying expensive products such as jewellery.</p>
